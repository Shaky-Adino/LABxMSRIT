A stack data structure can be imagined to be similar to a stack of plates where a new plate can be put on top and a plate can be removed from the top. To remove the last plate, all the plates on top have to be removed.`}</p>

The operation of  adding an element to the stack is called push, while the operation of removing an element is called pop.`}</p>

            <br />
            <p><span>Push: </span>Operation to add an element to the top of the stack</p>
            <p><span>Pop: </span>Operation to remove an element from the top of the stack</p>
            <p><span>isEmpty: </span>Operation to check if the stack is empty</p>

            <p><span>Peek: </span>Operation to find the value of the element on top of the stack</p>
            <br />
            <p>A pointer called TOP is used to keep track of the element on top of the stack. When a stack is created, TOP is initialized to -1. 
                If TOP == -1, the stack is empty. While pushing an element, the value of TOP is incremented by 1 and the new element is placed in the position pointed to by TOP. 
                While popping an element from the stack, the element pointed to by TOP is returned and the value of TOP is decremented by 1. Before pushing, the stack is checked to see if it is already full. 
                Before popping, the stack is checked to see if it is already empty.
