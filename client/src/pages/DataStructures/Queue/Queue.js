            <p>{`A queue is a data structure that follows the First In First Out principle. The element added first is accessed first. A queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue).
            
A real-world example of a queue can be a single-lane one-way road, where the vehicle that enters first, exits first.`}</p>

            <h3>FIFO Principle of Queue</h3>
            <p>{`The element added first is accessed first following the First In First Out principle. In the example, 1 is added first and accessed first.
The operation of adding an element to the queue is called enqueue, while the operation of removing an element is called dequeue.`}</p>

            <br />
            <p><span>Enqueue: </span>Operation to add an element to the end of the queue</p>
            <p><span>Dequeue: </span>Operation to remove an element from the front of the queue</p>

            <p>Two pointers, front and rear, are used to maintain a queue. Front tracks the first element of the queue, 
                while rear tracks the last element of the queue. Front and rear are initialized to -1. If rear is equal 
                to MAXSIZE of queue, then queue is full. If front and rear are equal to -1, then queue is empty. 
                When adding an element to the queue, the value of rear is incremented by 1 and the new element is placed 
                at the position pointed to by rear. When removing an element, increment the value of front by 1 and 
                return the value pointed by front. Before insertion, check if the queue is full. Before removing an element,
                 check if the queue is empty.
